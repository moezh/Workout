  "instruction": "Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart and face forward. Start kicking your feet up, until the heels touch the glutes, and pump your arms at the same time. Repeat until set is complete.",
  "hints": "Keep your shoulders back, your abs tight, to open up your chest, and to land slowly on the balls of your feet. Keep your arms close to your torso and your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Breathe out as you kick back and maintain a steady and stable pace. Pump your arms in sync with the opposite leg."
